* pytorch-explanatory-commentary-element-recognition
* it is similar to a sequence labeling task, you can regard as NER task. In my project, we use eval standard is same as conll2003 dataset 
* enviroment: pytorch 0.4.1 
* method:
  * bilstm + crf as based framework
  * bilstm + cnn + crf, add strokes features by cnn
* data:
  * hotel & phone domain commentary sentences, show three small dataset in Data file
* result:
  * hotel  
  * phone
* this project some encodes refer to my classmate, https://github.com/bamtercelboo/pytorch_NER_BiLSTM_CNN_CRF.  if you have any question, you'd ask him or me for this project. his address is bamtercelboo@gmail.com/bamtercelboo@163.com and my address is fzh_common@163.com .
